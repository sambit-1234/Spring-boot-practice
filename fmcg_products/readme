if product is deleted by its productCode then only the single product is deleted and not its associations
because other products are there for that category and ClassificationType as well

if Category is deleted then along with the category all the Products within it are also deleted

if ClassificationType is deleted then all categories under it along with all products within those categories will be deleted
